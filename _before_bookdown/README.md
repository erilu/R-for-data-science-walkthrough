# R for Data Science (r4ds) walkthrough - notes and solutions

The free online version of the book **R for Data Science** by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund can be found at http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html. This is the version that I will be working with.

Here, I work through the chapters of the book and provide solutions to their exercises, and also mix in some of my own notes and explorations. I highly recommend walking through their book if you are trying to learn how to use the tidyverse for data wrangling and analysis.

I've written my notes and answers in R markdown ```.Rmd``` files, which I've rendered as ```github_document``` in RStudio. This produces files with the extension ```.md```, which should display the output of the R code (graphs, tables, etc.) immediately after each R code chunk when viewed on GitHub in your browser. These files will be more informative than the ```.Rmd``` files which do not display the output.

The files are split up into groups of chapters within the book which focus on a common topic, listed below:

* [Chapters 1-3](https://github.com/erilu/R-for-data-science-walkthrough/blob/master/r4ds_p1_chapters1-3_walkthrough.md) Data Visualization using ggplot2
* [Chapters 4-6](https://github.com/erilu/R-for-data-science-walkthrough/blob/master/r4ds_p2_chapters4-6_walkthrough.md) Data Transformation using dplyr
* [Chapters 7-8](https://github.com/erilu/R-for-data-science-walkthrough/blob/master/r4ds_p3_chapters7-8_walkthrough.md) Exploratory Data Analysis
* [Chapters 9-13](https://github.com/erilu/R-for-data-science-walkthrough/blob/master/r4ds_p4_chapters9-13_walkthrough.md) Data Wranging Part 1 - Tibbles, Data Import, Tidy Data, and Relational Data.
* [Chapters 14-16](https://github.com/erilu/R-for-data-science-walkthrough/blob/master/r4ds_p5_chapters14-16_walkthrough.md) Data Wranging Part 2 - Strings, Factors, Dates, and Times
* [Chapters 17-21](https://github.com/erilu/R-for-data-science-walkthrough/blob/master/r4ds_p6_chapters17-21_walkthrough.md) Functions, Vectors, and Iteration
* [Chapters 22-30](https://github.com/erilu/R-for-data-science-walkthrough/blob/master/r4ds_p7_chapters22-30_walkthrough.md) Model basics and building, graphics, and R markdown

Thanks for stopping by! I hope my notes have helped you in your journey to learn techniques data science!
