# R for Data Science (r4ds) walkthrough - notes and solutions

The free online version of the book **R for Data Science** by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund can be found at http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html. Here, I walk through the book chapter by chapter and provide solutions to their exercises, as well as mix in some of my own notes and explorations. I highly recommend walking through their book if you are trying to learn how to use the tidyverse for data wrangling.

I've written my notes and answers in R markdown ```.Rmd``` files, which I've rendered as ```github_document``` in RStudio. This produces files with the extension ```.md```, which should display the output of the R code (graphs, tables, etc.) immediately after each R code chunk. Please view these files, since they will be more informative than the ```.Rmd``` files. The files are split up into groups of chapters within the book which focus on a common topic (visualization using ggplot2, transforming data, etc.)

Links to walkthrough:

* [Chapters 1-3](https://github.com/erilu/R-for-data-science-walkthrough/blob/master/r4ds_chapters1-3_walkthrough.md) Data Visualization using ggplot2
* [Chapters 4-6](https://github.com/erilu/R-for-data-science-walkthrough/blob/master/r4ds_chapters4-6_walkthrough.md) Data Transformation
* [Chapters 7-8](https://github.com/erilu/R-for-data-science-walkthrough/blob/master/r4ds_chapters7-8_walkthrough.md) Exploratory Data Analysis (in progress)

Thanks for stopping by! I hope my notes have helped you in your journey to learn techniques data science!
