This my walkthrough for chapters 14-16 for the book: _R for Data Science_ by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. Here I provide solutions to their exercises and some of my own notes and explorations.

# Chapter 14 Strings

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


## 14.2.5 Exercises

### 1. In code that doesn’t use stringr, you’ll often see paste() and paste0(). What’s the difference between the two functions? What stringr function are they equivalent to? How do the functions differ in their handling of NA?

The paste() function and paste0() functions are used to concatenate vectors after converting to character. In other words, combine converted strings together into one string. paste0() differs from paste() in that it always combines the strings without  a separating value, whereas paste() allows you to specify the ```sep``` argument. When sep = "", paste() provides the same output as paste0(). The stringr function they are equivalent to is str_c(). 

```{r}
p = NA
paste("the value of p is ", p)
str_c("the value of p is ", p)
```

### 2. In your own words, describe the difference between the sep and collapse arguments to str_c().

The sep argument allows you to specify what types of characters will lie between the items being joined. For example, you can choose to separate things with commas rather than the default no-space "". These separators will be inserted between each separate item fed into str_c, and will not be placed if a pre-vectorized argument is provided. If you have a premade vector that you want to join into one string with a specified separator, the collapse argument should be used, in which you specify the type of separator you want inserted. Below is an example illustrating these points.

```{r}
join_me <- c(88, "hello", "world")
str_c(88, "hello", "world")
str_c(88, "hello", "world", sep = ", ")
# sep does not place the commas if a premade vector is fed into str_c
str_c(join_me, sep = ", ")

# use collapse instead if you want to place separators into premade vector
str_c(join_me, collapse = ", ")

```


### 3. Use str_length() and str_sub() to extract the middle character from a string. What will you do if the string has an even number of characters?

To extract the middle character from a string, we can use str_length()/2 to find the middle index of the string, then use str_sub() to extract the character at that index. For even character strings, it would make sense to extract the two characters at the very center of the string. I wrote a function get_middle() that would test whether a string has an even number or odd number of characters using %%, then apply the appropriate str_sub() command to get the middle character or middle two characters.

```{r}
get_middle <- function (my_str) {
  if (str_length(my_str)%%2 != 0){
    return (str_sub(my_str, ceiling(str_length(my_str)/2), ceiling(str_length(my_str)/2)))
  } else {
    return (str_sub(my_str, ceiling(str_length(my_str)/2), ceiling(str_length(my_str)/2+1)))
  }
}

get_middle ("qwert")
get_middle ("qwerty")
```

### 4. What does str_wrap() do? When might you want to use it?

str_wrap(), as the name suggests, wraps a string into a paragraph. You can specify how wide to make each line of the paragraph using the width argument. It does so by inserting a newline '\n' at the appropriate positions. This would be useful for printing very long strings. Below is an example of using str_wrap().

```{r}
long_string <- 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.'

long_string
str_wrap(long_string, width = 30)

```

### 5. What does str_trim() do? What’s the opposite of str_trim()?

str_trim() will remove whitespace from the start and end of a string. The opposite of str_trim() is str_pad(), which can be used to add whitespace to either the left, right, or both sides of a string. Below is an example of using both functions.

```{r}
whitespace <- "  why is there whitespace on both sides?   "
whitespace
str_trim(whitespace)
str_pad("add some whitespace to the left!", 40, side = "left")
```

### 6. Write a function that turns (e.g.) a vector c("a", "b", "c") into the string a, b, and c. Think carefully about what it should do if given a vector of length 0, 1, or 2.

We can write a function that checks the length of the vector using length() and uses if else statements to perform the appropriate action. For vectors of length 0, we should return an empty string "". For vectors of length 1, we should just return the single item as-is. For vectors of length > 1, we should return the output specified in the question: "item-1, item-2, ... item-n-1, and item-n". To combine the items in the vector appropriately, we can first collapse the first n-1 items using str_c( collapse = ", "), then use str_c on this collapsed string with ", and ", and with the last item in the vector. This will insert the commas at the right locations, as well as the word "and" right before the last item in the vector.

```{r}
# function name is convert_str
convert_str <- function (str_vector) {
  if (length(str_vector) == 0) {
    return ("")
  } else if (length (str_vector) == 1) {
    return (str_vector[1])
  } else {
    combined_minus_last <- str_c(str_vector[1:(length(str_vector)-1)], collapse = ", ") # collapse all items except the last one
    return( str_c (combined_minus_last, ", and ", str_vector[length(str_vector)])) # concatenate the word "and" and the last item
  }
}

convert_str(c("fee", "fi", "fo", "fum"))
convert_str(c("fee"))
convert_str(c())
```



## 14.3.1.1 Exercises

### 1. Explain why each of these strings don’t match a \: "\", "\\", "\\\".

To match a literal ```\```, you need to use four backslashes, "\\\\". One backslash, two backslashes, and 3 backslashes wont work! One backslash "\" won't work because it will "escape" the quotation, resulting in an error. Using 3 backslashes "\\\" will also result in an error, and using 4 backslashes "\\\\" will finally let us match the single literal \.

```{r}
literal_backslash <- "hello_\\_world"
writeLines(literal_backslash)
# str_view(literal_backslash, "\\\\")

# errors
# x <- "\"
# x <- "\\\"
```

### 2. How would you match the sequence "'\?

I would use the regex: "\"\'\\\\". This escapes the ", escapes the ', then uses the four backslashes to identify the literal \.

```{r}
example <- "hello_\"\'\\_world"
writeLines(example)
# str_view(example, "\"\'\\\\" )
```

### 3. What patterns will the regular expression \..\..\.. match? How would you represent it as a string?

If interepreted as a regular expression and not as the string-form of a regular expression, this will match a period ```\.```, followed by any character ```.```, followed by another period, any character, another period, and then any character. Below, I've represented it as a string in R. Because of the backslash convention, it will error if you try to plug ```\..\..\..``` in directly.

```{r}
# test <- "\..\..\.." # errors

# need to double backslash within the string
test <- "\\..\\..\\.."
writeLines(test)
```

## 14.3.2.1 Exercises

### 1. How would you match the literal string "$^$"?

Below, i use ```"\\$\\^\\$"``` to match the literal string ```"$^$"```. This is because you have to double backslash the $ and ^ characters, which usually serve the purpose of matching the end or start of strings, respectively.

```{r}
test <- "$^$hello"
writeLines(test)
str_view(test, "\\$\\^\\$")
```


### 2. Given the corpus of common words in stringr::words, create regular expressions that find all words that:

* Start with “y”.
* End with “x”
* Are exactly three letters long. (Don’t cheat by using str_length()!)
* Have seven letters or more.
Since this list is long, you might want to use the match argument to str_view() to show only the matching or non-matching words.

To match words that start with y, use the "^" anchor before "y". To match words that end with x, use the "\$" anchor after "x". To match words that are exactly three letters long, we can use both anchors "^" and "\$" wrapped around 3 dots, which specify a series of any 3 characters. To match words that have seven letters or more, we can use the "^" anchor plus seven dots, which specify a series of any seven characters.

```{r}
# display a sample of stringr::words
head(words)

# starts with "y"
str_view(words, "^y", match = T)
# ends with "x"
str_view(words, "x$", match = T)
# are exactly 3 letters long
str_view(words, "^...$")
# have seven letters or more
str_view(words, "^.......")
```


## 14.3.3.1 Exercises
### 1. Create regular expressions to find all words that:

* Start with a vowel.
* That only contain consonants. (Hint: thinking about matching “not”-vowels.)
* End with ed, but not with eed.
* End with ing or ise.

To find words that start with vowels, we can use the "^" anchor along with a selection of vowels using the brackets. To find words that only contain consonants, we can specify that, from start to end (using ^ and \$), there are no vowels (using ^ within brackets, along with the + sign, which means 1 or more of something). To find words that end in ed, but not eed, we can specify that we want words that end with ed, but have anything other than an e beforehand using [^e]. For words that end in ing or ise, we can use the "or" character "|" to combine two separate regexes, one that looks for ing\$ and one that looks for ise\$. Below are the regexes I have described in words above.

```{r}
# starts with a vowel
str_view(words, "^[aeiou]")
# only contain consonants
str_view(words, "^[^aeiou]+$", match = T)
# ends with ed, but not eed
str_view(words, "[^e]ed$", match = T)
# ends with ing or ise
str_view(words, "ing$|ise$", match = T)

```

### 2. Empirically verify the rule “i before e except after c”.

To examine whether any words in the dataset break this rule, we can search for words with the sequence of characters "cie", which contain an i before e even after a c. This yields the words "science" an "society". This tells us that the rule is not 100% correct! Searching for "cei", which will show words that adhere to the rule, yields "receive", which tells us that the rule might be correct for certain words. Is i always before e, even after something that is not c? Searching for words that do not follow this convention (i AFTER e, after anything other than a c) using the regex "[^c]ei" yields the word "weigh", which again disproves the rule. Searching for words that follow the rule (ie before e, after anything other than a c) using the regex "[^c]ie" yields many results, which shows us that the rule applies for most words, but not all of them.

```{r}
# list words that contain i before e, after a c. if this yields matches, then the rule is false!
str_view(words, "cie", match = T)
str_view(words, "cei", match = T)
str_view(words, "[^c]ei", match = T)
str_view(words, "[^c]ie", match = T)

```

### 3. Is “q” always followed by a “u”?

In the words dataset, we can identify words that contain q followed by any character using the regex "q.". All the results contain "q" followed by a "u". Alternatively, we can identify words that contain q followed by anything other than a "u", using "q[^u]". Because this does not yield any results, it does seem like "q" is followed by a "u" in this dataset.

```{r}
# list words that contain q followed by any character
str_view(words, "q.", match = T)
# list words that contain q followed by something other than u (no matches)
str_view(words, "q[^u]", match = T)
```

### 4. Write a regular expression that matches a word if it’s probably written in British English, not American English.

Some common differences between British and American English include colour instead of color, so we could look for the sequence "lou". Other differences include "summarize" vs "summarise", so we could also include a search for the sequence "ise". Of course, this will also fetch words such as "practice" that do not have two forms.

```{r}
str_view(words, "lou|ise", match = T)
```


### 5. Create a regular expression that will match telephone numbers as commonly written in your country.

Phone numbers in the US can have the form (XXX) XXX - XXXX. Below is the regex that can be used to identify, very strictly, numbers that adhere to this exact form (including spacing and parenthesis). Note the double backslash required to specify a digit. There is a more efficient way to write the regex below using brackets {}, but that is covered in the next section!

```{r}
str_view ( c("(123) 456 - 7890 is a fake number,","and (555) 555 - 5555 is also a fake number"), "\\(\\d\\d\\d\\)\\s\\d\\d\\d\\s-\\s\\d\\d\\d\\d")

# same regex using brackets
str_view ( c("(123) 456 - 7890 is a fake number,","and (555) 555 - 5555 is also a fake number"), "\\(\\d{3}\\)\\s\\d{3}\\s-\\s\\d{4}")

writeLines(c("(\\d\\d\\d)\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d", "\\(\\d{3}\\)\\s\\d{3}\\s-\\s\\d{4}"))
```



## 14.3.4.1 Exercises

### 1. Describe the equivalents of ?, +, * in {m,n} form.

? is equivalent to {0,1} in that it matches either 0 or 1 occurances of the preceding regex or character. + is equivalent to {1,} in that it matches 1 or more occurances of the character/regex. * is equivalent to {0,} in that it matches from 0 to any number of occurances of the character/regex.

### 2. Describe in words what these regular expressions match: (read carefully to see if I’m using a regular expression or a string that defines a regular expression.)

* ```^.*$```
This matches any series of characters of 0 to any length. The anchor ^ specifies the start of the string, the . specifies any character, and the * specifies that the previous regex, (.), can be of 0 to any length, and the $ specifies the end of the string.

* ```"\\{.+\\}"```
This matches a literal bracket, {,  followed by 1 or more series of any characters, followed by a literal closing bracket, }. This will match strings like: "{hello world}".

* ```\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}```
This will match 4 digits, followed by a hyphen, two digits, a hyphen, and another 2 digits. For example: "5555-55-55"

* ```"\\\\{4}"```
This will match a literal backslash repeated 4 times. For example: ```\\\\```.

Here are the above regexes and some sample input so you can see what types of character sequences they match:

```{r}
str_view(words, "^.*$")
str_view("hello world, {hello world} hello world", "\\{.+\\}")
str_view("5555-55-55asdf", "\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}")
str_view("\\\\\\\\asdf", "\\\\{4}")
```

### 3. Create regular expressions to find all words that:

* Start with three consonants.
* Have three or more vowels in a row.
* Have two or more vowel-consonant pairs in a row.

```{r}
# three consonants
str_view("street", '[^aeiou]{3}')

#three or more vowels in a row:
str_view("streeet", '[aeiou]{3,}')

# two or more vowel-consonant pairs in a row:
str_view("streettttt", '([aeiou][^aeiou]|[^aeiou][aeiou]){2,}')

```

### 4. Solve the beginner regexp crosswords at https://regexcrossword.com/challenges/beginner.

Here are the solutions with some explanations to how I arrived at the answers:

Beginner puzzle 1, Beatles: row 1: HE|LL|O+, row2: [PLEASE]+, column 1: [^SPEAK]+, column 2: EP|IP|EF. Solution: row1: HE, row2: LP.

First examine row 1 vs column 2- column 2 can either start with the letter E or I, but the only option in row 1 that will fit with this requirement is "HE". For row 2, the only letter that can be in the bottom left is L, since P, E, A, and S are not allowed by column 1. The bottom right can only contain letters from PLEASE, which means that the option EF for column 2 is not allowed. This leaves EP as the only possibility for column 2. So row 2 must be "LP".

Beginner puzzle 2, Naughty: row 1: ```.*M?O.*```, row2: (AN|FE|BE), column 1: ```(A|B|C)\1```, column 2: (AB|OE|SK). Solution: row1: BO, row2: BE.

Row 1 specifies that there can be 0-1 of any character, followed by 0-1 of M, followed by O, followed by 0-1 of any character. The only stringent requirement is that there exist an O in row 1. Looking at column 1, this does not allow the letter O, so O must be in column 2 of row 1. The only option that allows this is the "OE" option in column 2. The two options for row 2 that end with letter E are "FE" or "BE". However, column 1 dictates that the first letter of row2 must be either A, B, or C. The only option that fits this is "BB" for column 2.

Beginner puzzle 3, Ghost: row 1: ```(.)+\1```, row2: [^ABRC]+, column 1: [COBRA]+, column 2: (AB|O|OR)+. Solution: row1: OO, row2: OO.

Row 1 specifies that 1 or more of any character should be repeated. Given the 2x2 box, this means a pair of letters. Column 1 gives COBRA as choices, but row2 specifies that ABRC cannot be present. This leaves us with O. Also, for column 2, the only option that is available that would not violate row2's rules is O+.

Beginner puzzle 4, Symbolism: row 1: ```[*]+```, row2: /+, column 1: .?.+, column 2: .+. Solution: row1: ```**```, row2:```//```.

Row1 wants 1 or more *, whereas row 2 wants one or more /. Column 1 states that any character can occur 0-1 times followed by another character at least 1 or more times. Column 2 states that any character must appear 1 or more times.

Beginner puzzle 5, Airstrip One: row 1: 18|19|20, row2: ```[6789]\d```, column 1: ```\d[2480]```, column 2: 56|94|73. Solution: row1: 19, row2: 84.

The only choice for row1 that would satisfy the requirements for column2 is 19 (row1 ends with 9 and col 2 begins with 9). This means that column2 downwards is 94. The only choice for the bottom left that satisfies row2, and column 1 is 8. This leaves us with 19 in row1 and 84 in row2 as the answer.

## 14.3.5.1 Exercises

### 1. Describe, in words, what these expressions will match:

* (.)\1\1

This will match any character repeated 3 times. For example, "ooo" in the string "woohooo!"
```{r}
str_view("woohooo!", "(.)\\1\\1")
```

* "(.)(.)\\2\\1"

This will match a pair of characters followed by the reverse of the pair. For example, "elle" in "belle".

```{r}
str_view("belle", "(.)(.)\\2\\1")
```

* ```(..)\1```

This will match any two characters repeated twice. For example, "caca" in "cacao beans".

```{r}
str_view("cacao beans", "(..)\\1")
```

* ```"(.).\\1.\\1"```

This matches any character repeated every other character, such as "lulul" in "lululemon".

```{r}
str_view("lululemon", "(.).\\1.\\1")
```

* ```"(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1"```

This matches 3 characters followed by any number of characters followed by the first 3 characters in reverse, such as "but the tub" in "but the tub is full".

```{r}
str_view("but the tub is full", "(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1")
```

### 2. Construct regular expressions to match words that:

* Start and end with the same character.

```"^(.).*\\1$"``` performs this function. The ^ anchor specifies that any character (.) must also be present at the end of hte string using the \$ anchor after the backreference. Below, it will match "regular" but not "expression".

```{r}
str_view(c("regular","expressions", "a", "aa"), "^(.).*\\1$")
```

* Contain a repeated pair of letters (e.g. “church” contains “ch” repeated twice.)

```"(..).*\\1"``` will work by specifying that any two characters (..) can be separated by any amount of characters .* followed by the same two characters using a backreference.

```{r}
str_view(c("church", "no repeats", "papaya"), "(..).*\\1")
```

* Contain one letter repeated in at least three places (e.g. “eleven” contains three “e”s.)

```"(.).*\\1.*\\1"``` would work for single word strings. If there is a sentence with multiple words, this regex would match the first occurance of 3 characters, including whitespace, even if they were in different words. If we don't want this to happen, we would use a "anything except whitespace" instead of ```.*```. This would be a regexp for that purpose: ```"([^\\s])[^\\s]*\\1[^\\s]*\\1"```. We could also use the boundary regexp ```\\b```.

```{r}
# this only works for individual words
str_view(c("eleven", "apply", "papaya", "bananas", "will this match spaces?","letters next"), "(.).*\\1.*\\1")
# this will exclude whitespace and only match if a word within a sentence has a letter repeated 3 times.
str_view(c("eleven", "apply", "papaya", "bananas", "will this match spaces?", "letters next"), "([^\\s])[^\\s]*\\1[^\\s]*\\1")
```


## 14.4.2 Exercises

### 1. For each of the following challenges, try solving it by using both a single regular expression, and a combination of multiple str_detect() calls.

* Find all words that start or end with x.

```{r}
# single expression
str_subset(words, "^x|x$")
# multiple str_detect() calls
c(words[str_detect(words, "^x")], words[str_detect(words, "x$")])
```

* Find all words that start with a vowel and end with a consonant.

```{r}
# single expression
str_subset(words, "^[aeiou].*[^aeiou]$")
# multiple str_detect() calls
words [ str_detect(words, "^[aeiou]") & str_detect(words, "[^aeiou]$")]
```

* Are there any words that contain at least one of each different vowel?

To determine whether there are any words that contain at least one of each vowel, we can look for words that have just one of each vowel to make things simpler (any words with more than one of any vowell will still be matched). This is much easier done using multiple str_detect() calls, beacuse we do not care where the vowels show up within the word. "a" can be before "i", or after "i", or between "o" and "u", which makes things complicated if we want to use a single regular expression. We would have to type out all the permutations and chain them using .* and OR (|). This would be a huge expression! Below is the simpler way of chaining multiple str_detect() calls. No words have at least one of each vowell, but some have a,e i, and o (no u).

```{r}
# multiple str_detect() calls
words[str_detect(words, "a") & str_detect(words, "e") &  str_detect(words, "i") & str_detect(words, "o") & str_detect (words, "u")]
# words with a, e, i, and o (no u)
words[str_detect(words, "a") & str_detect(words, "e") &  str_detect(words, "i") & str_detect(words, "o") ]
```

### 2. What word has the highest number of vowels? What word has the highest proportion of vowels? (Hint: what is the denominator?)

To figure this out, we need a way to count the number of vowels in each word in ```words```, which we can do with str_count() and the regexp ```[aeiou]```. This will let us know the number of vowels in each word, but we also want to keep the information about what the original word was. This means we should perform str_count() on a data frame that contains the original words as well as their index. The book provides this as a tibble. We can perform a mutate() using str_count() and also get the length of each word using str_length(), then calculate the proportion by dividing the two metrics. Then we can use arrange() to find the words with the highest vowel count and vowel proportion. The highest vowel count is 5, which includes appropriate, associate, available, colleague, encourage, experience, individual, and television. The highest vowel proportion is the word "a", which has a proportion of 1 (it itself is a vowel). Non-1 letter words with the highest vowel proportion include area and idea, at 0.75.

```{r}
# create indexed words tibble
df <- tibble(
  word = words, 
  i = seq_along(word)
)
# calculate number of vowels and proportion of vowels by word
vowels <- df %>%
  mutate ( num_vowels = str_count(words, "[aeiou]"),
           length_word = str_length(words),
           proportion_vowel = num_vowels/length_word)
# sort by words with highest number or proportion of vowels
vowels %>%
  arrange (desc(num_vowels))
vowels %>%
  arrange (desc(proportion_vowel))

```


## 14.4.3.1 Exercises

### 1. In the previous example, you might have noticed that the regular expression matched “flickered”, which is not a colour. Modify the regex to fix the problem.

We can modify the regex to detect only legitimate colors by adding a whitespace character on both sides of the name of each color. This will match sentences where a colour is only one word. However, dual-colors like "orangered" or "orange-red" will not be matched unless explicitly stated in the colours vector. To do this, we could change the whitespace to a boundary regex ```"\\b"```.

```{r}
colours <- c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple")
colours_fixed <- str_c("\\s", colours, "\\s")
colours_fixed
colour_match <- str_c(colours_fixed, collapse = "|")
has_colour <- str_subset(sentences, colour_match)
has_colour

more <- sentences[str_count(sentences, colour_match) > 1]
str_view_all(more, colour_match)
```

### 2. From the Harvard sentences data, extract:

* The first word from each sentence.

To do this, use the ^ anchor and look for all characters that lie before the first whitespace.

```{r}
first_words <- str_extract(sentences, "^.+?\\s")
head(first_words,20)
```

* All words ending in ing.

To do this, first find the subset of sentences that have "ing" before a boundary character. Then, within these sentences, extract the word containing "ing" before the boundary character.

```{r}
with_ing <- str_subset(sentences, "ing\\b")
head(with_ing)
words_ing <- str_extract(with_ing, "\\b\\w+ing\\b")
words_ing

```

* All plurals.

Below is a way to find all words that end in "s", which should capture plurals that end in "s", as well as other non-plural words that also end in "s", such as "press". To decipher which of these are plurals of singular words, we could subtract the "s" from the words and see if the resulting word matches a dictionary of specified singular words, which we don't have here. To decipher which words are plurals using only a regex doesn't seem straightforward and would require something very convoluted.

```{r}
with_plural <- str_subset(sentences, "\\b\\w+s\\s")
head(with_plural)
words_plural <- str_extract(with_plural, "\\b\\w+s\\s")
head(words_plural)
```

## 14.4.4.1 Exercises

### 1. Find all words that come after a “number” like “one”, “two”, “three” etc. Pull out both the number and the word.



### 2. Find all contractions. Separate out the pieces before and after the apostrophe.




## 14.4.5.1 Exercises

### 1. Replace all forward slashes in a string with backslashes.

### 2. Implement a simple version of str_to_lower() using replace_all().

### 3. Switch the first and last letters in words. Which of those strings are still words?



## 14.4.6.1 Exercises
